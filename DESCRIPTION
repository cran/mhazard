Description: Estimates the survival function and Cox regression parameters
    for the multivariate survival setting where there are multiple
    (right-censored) outcome variables. The Volterra, Dabrowska, and
    Prentice-Cai estimates of the bivariate survival function may be
    computed as well as the Dabrowska estimate of the trivariate survival
    function. Bivariate Cox regression estimates can also be computed.
    Functions are also provided to compute (bootstrap) confidence intervals
    and plot the estimates of the bivariate survival function. For details,

    Marginal Modeling Approach", Prentice, R., Zhao, S. (2019, ISBN:
    978-1-4822-5657-4), CRC Press.
